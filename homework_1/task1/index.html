    <h1>Meet Jack</h1>
    <img class="jp" src="./jack.gif" alt="jackpic" />
    <p>
      This is Jack, he is a
      <span>begginning developer</span>
      , and he just starts learning
      <span>web programming</span>
      . But he is a little bit dissappointed, since he got lots of homework
      lately and Jack couldnt find reliable source of knowledge. Now lets give
      him a gift to help him feel better.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>Jack would really like:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML and CSS manual</li>
        <li>Book for Algorithms</li>
        <li>Magic tool to learn Turkish</li>
        <li>Big brain to master JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Well, we cant give him a magic tool and big brain, we still can give him a
      knowledge.Very popular links using which he can learn HTML and CSS are:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube</a> and
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w2schools</a>.
